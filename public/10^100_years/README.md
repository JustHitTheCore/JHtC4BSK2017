 “If for the entire universe we conceive the same magnitude to be determined, consistently and with due regard to all circumstances, [...] and if at the same time we introduce the other and simpler conception of energy, we may express in the following manner the fundamental laws of the universe which correspond to the two fundamental theorems of the mechanical theory of heat: the energy of the universe is constant; the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.” 

    — Rudolf Clausius (1865) Mechanical Theory of Heat (1865)
