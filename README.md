# JHtC4BSK2017

Tasks from mini CTF prepared by JHtC mostly for MIMUW students attending BSK course.

To host it all, you need Docker and docker-compose installed. Then you just fire `./host_tasks.sh`. It will spawn docker containers with all the tasks that needs to be available through net.

The `public` directory contains tasks descriptions and files that were available during the CTF.
